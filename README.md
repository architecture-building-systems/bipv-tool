# bipv-tool
Tool for the planning of BIPV Systems

The software within this repository consists of three partially independent parts. The workflow starts with the irradiance simulation. A string optimisation can be run before the electrical simulation.

The tool as it is on the repository now, is not yet completely ready-to-use on other computers.
